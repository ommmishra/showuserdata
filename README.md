# showuserdata
A simple program that uses jsp and servlet to shows user name upon input.
This program redirects the user to a welcome page which shows the input he made during login.
To make this working the user must have an ide installed(for java web application).
An working server connection is required(I used tomcat 9.0).
Open the workspace and create a web application.
Copy the "login.java" file in src.
Copy "info.jsp" & "login.jsp" in WebContent.
Now try to run the program using suitable server.
Hope you find this content helpful.
