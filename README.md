# showuserdata
a simple program that uses jsp and servlet to shows user name upon input
This program redirects the user to a welcome page which shows the input he made during login
to make this working the user must have an ide installed(for java web application)
an working server connection is required(I used tomcat 9.0)
open the workspace and create a web application
copy the "login.java" file in src
copy "info.jsp" & "login.jsp" in WebContent
now try to run the program using suitable server
hope you find this content helpful
